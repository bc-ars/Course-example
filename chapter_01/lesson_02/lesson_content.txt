# ‚ÑπÔ∏è An Information Technology 



## BIM is an information technology

BIM is an information and communication technology, why?

It is a method of project and work management that will be structured around a digital model where we will find all the information of a project in its life cycle. BIM will make it possible to manage and store information, exchange, research, collaborate and specify information through this digital model.

Nowadays, construction projects in which young engineers collaborate at the start of their careers no longer use rot rings or drawing tables for the creation of plans. Older collaborators sometimes evoke these design tools with nostalgia‚Ä¶.

*Original rotring - very useful for sketching design and measurements*

Just as mail has replaced mail and fax, two-dimensional and occasionally three-dimensional Computer Aided Design (CAD) software is succeeding paper drawings. The last few years have seen a real revolution appear: the Building Information Modeling, or Digital Model and Mockup or BIM. According to the French Building Federation ( [www.ffbim.fr](http://www.ffbim.fr/) ), BIM is defined as ‚Äúa database, completed and updated by each professional as the project progresses, from its programming to its deconstruction ‚Äù. It is an information modeling of the infrastructure, tracing the construction process, as well as the management and the representation of the project.

BIM is part of a series of developments where we can distinguish: hand drawing, 2D computer-aided design (AutoCad), 3D computer-aided design (AutoCad, 3DSMax) and BIM:

The world of Architecture, Building Engineering and Civil Engineering is finally experiencing its digital transformation.

- In the 80s, Computer Aided Drawing appeared.
- In the 90s, CAD (Computer Aided Design) appeared
- The years 2010 and 2020 see the advent of BIM.

It is more than simple drawing and design, the data is added and completed with the three-dimensional representation.

*We gradually move from CAD to 2D CAD then 3D to arrive at BIM*

## How do you draw a project?

All these developments lead us to rethink the act of designing a project, how to transcribe abstract ideas and communicate them?

 

### Hand drawing and 2D CAD

------

An architect is traditionally imagined as a person in front of a drawing board with a pencil, a ruler, a compass, a square ... The designer produces different types of plans such as sections, perspectives, floor plans ... Architect uses paper and layers to test different versions of his project. We always find today this way of working with experienced architects or in phases very upstream of the project to show sketches to the client.

*The architect at work*

In this way of working we project ideas by means of a geometry linked to our medium which is a 2D rendering. The way of thinking is the same but the advantage of CAD comes in the industrialization of the process. You can easily copy and paste, reproduce on a larger scale, print, represent alternatives and delete them ...

![Hand-drawing_& _2D _CAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/English_BIM_Fundamentals/Hand-drawing_& _2D _CAD.png)

In 1963, an engineer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by the name of **Ivan Sutherland** proposed **Sketchpad** software . It is one of the first software to have a graphical interface allowing computer-assisted drawing to be done. Then in 1977 came CAD software called **CADAM** , which was the first for professional use. Long before construction, aeronautics innovated in the design of prototypes through the progressive use of CAD. We then saw the emergence of software such as **AutoCAD** in 1982, and **Archicad** in 1984. The representation was thus carried out by means of lines and surfaces.

The manual technique consisting in making sketches on paper (implicitly containing geometric shapes) is then transposed on the computer. it is the same way of drawing, except that it is possible to industrialize the process, modify or cancel an action without damaging the support as when drawing on paper.

If we were to summarize and compare these two techniques:

| 2D HIGH                                                      | ‚úçÔ∏è Hand drawing                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick plan design                                            | Unique and difficult to duplicate                          |
| Infinitely duplicable and very quickly                       | All changes involve significant costs and inefficient time |
| Easy and easy modification (we manipulate line and point elements) | Provide eraser and pencils                                 |
| You can reuse the plan or some of its sections               | No.....                                                    |
| We can create and imagine different versions                 | Provide eraser, pencils and papers                         |

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



### 2D CAD and 3D CAD

--------------------------

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Thanks to **3D, the project becomes much more visualizable and closer to reality** . We understand the project more quickly and communication is simpler, even for the uninitiated, misunderstandings are reduced.

We distinguish between 2D CAD and 3D CAD. For example in 2D CAD a slab can be modeled by lines which will only have a geometric link as a link between them. In 3D CAD, the slab will be an object with geometric properties and other properties.

![2D_CAD_&_3D_CAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/English_BIM_Fundamentals/2D_CAD_&_3D_CAD.png)

In CAD, we tried to model the process of drawing by hand, while we move with **CAD to a link between objects with specific characteristics** . We can start talking about parametric modeling where any change has instantaneous implications on other parameters (e.g. dimensions). And we can start to carry out analyzes of surfaces, volumes...

To summarize:

| üíª 2D CAD                                                     | **üßä 3D CAD**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Objects are made up of geometric elements (sets of lines, with starting point and ending point, to represent architectural objects such as doors, windows, walls and balconies). | Geometric elements to which the 3rd dimension has been added. |
| Several independent drawings (plans, sections, elevations and axonometries). | It depends on the software                                   |
| Easy and easy modification (we manipulate line and point elements). | ‚úÖ                                                            |
| You can reuse the plan or some of its sections.              | It depends on the software                                   |
| We can create and imagine different versions.                | ‚úÖ                                                            |

### CAO 3D et BIM

--------------------------



The beginnings of BIM appeared in 1963 when Sutherland created Sketchpad software, a precursor of the graphical interface and CAD.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/BIM_Enjeux_et_Fondements/Sutherland.jpeg" alt="Sutherland" style="
    width: 50%;

*Ivan Sutherland*

Sketchpad (aka Robot Draftsman) is a computer program written by Ivan Sutherland in 1963 as part of his doctoral thesis at MIT; thesis for which he received a Turing Award in 1988 and the Kyoto Prize in 2012. Sketchpad is considered the forerunner of computer-aided design (CAD) software and pioneered human-machine interfaces (HMI) 1.

In 1992 van Nederveen & Tolman used the term **"Building Information Model"** for the first time in a scientific article. This article announces that technological advances now allow computers to assist architects in their design plans. It nevertheless highlights the fact that there are still many restrictions but invites designers to seize this technology to achieve complex designs. We are starting to talk about a "building model" which can be integrated into the DAO in technical design offices working on different disciplines.

BIM defines itself more than a Computer Aided Design tool but as a colleague to whom we will entrust automated tasks.

in 1984, **Archicad7**, developed by Graphisoft, was for many the **1st BIM software** . In 2000, **Revit** 8 (from "Revise it")  was released , bought in 2002 by Autodesk, which wrote the same year a white paper: Building Information Modeling. Like computer programming which whose languages evolve from variables to object-oriented programming, CAD now makes it possible to manipulate objects with own or shared parameters.

![3D_CAD_&_BIM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/English_BIM_Fundamentals/3D_CAD_&_BIM.png)

Avec la CAO 3D, il n'y a aucun rapport s√©mantique avec la construction. Le BIM reprend la logique de conception d'un b√¢timent avec ses diff√©rents composants (dont on va d'ailleurs commencer la conception de la m√™me mani√®re que le processus r√©el)

Pour r√©sumer:

| üßä 3D CAD                                                     | üíª  üèóÔ∏è  BIM                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| No link between 2D and 3D plans.                             | The modeling is parametric.                                  |
| The production of deliverables (plan, sections, elevations ...) is not an objective in 3D CAD. | The deliverables are permanently connected to the digital model and can be extracted anytime: (plan, sections, elevations, etc.). |
| The geometric system is independent of the way of constructing. | Each of the BIM objects has specific properties and information that can be enriched (materials, cost, thermal conductivity, maintenance, etc.). |

 <p>&nbsp;</p>

It is a major digital and even intellectual transformation. We are talking about an intelligent model. In addition to the realistic geometry of each of the objects, we have information about their components and their connections to others.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### The design tool becomes a decision support tool

------

 

Since the emergence of computer-aided drawing and 3D CAD, it has been a real disruption in the world of construction and architecture. Let's take the example of the intellectual journey in the design of a facade detail plan.

Manual drawing and 2D CAD start from the same principles. We started with a representation of the mind on a two-dimensional support: the sheet. We can distinguish 3 types of elements: the point, the line and the surface. This support has improved with the contribution of digital technology and its power of industrialization (copy, paste, edit, delete) with 2D CAD.

![facade_hand-drawingt_2D_CAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/English_BIM_Fundamentals/facade_hand-drawingt_2D_CAD.png)

We then move on to a geometry that is no longer flat but in volume, which allows us to better represent the objects in our mind.

![Facade_2D_CAD_3D_CAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/English_BIM_Fundamentals/Facade_2D_CAD_3D_CAD.png)

With BIM, objects become intelligent with final idea of the elements constituting a model of the construction. The parallelepiped can be a column, a wall, a slab, a partition. In addition to its length, width, height, it has its own characteristics: manufacturer references, brand, color, thermal capacity, etc... It can also have several constituent objects: partition, insulation, coating, metal upright...



<p>&nbsp;</p>

![facade_3D_CAD_BIM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/English_BIM_Fundamentals/facade_3D_CAD_BIM.png)We are entering a new paradigm with BIM. The design becomes object-oriented and will allow us to more faithfully reproduce the vision of architects and engineers.
