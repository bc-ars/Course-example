------------------------------



Depending on the scale and utility, digital technology is gradually establishing itself in the design of cities, buildings and their relationship to nature. Let's discover together how digital is rethinking all our way of predicting climatic, demographic and usage changes.



## BIM ? Qu√©saco ?

-------------------------------



BIM - commonly Building Information Modeling - is an intelligent 3D model-based process that provides architectural, engineering and construction professionals with the information and tools needed to plan, design, build and manage more efficiently buildings and infrastructure. Let us take the acronym in detail, it can have several meanings:



![B_IM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/BIM_Enjeux_et_Fondements/B_IM.jpeg)

The **B** refers to **Building** because here it is a technology that we want specific to the **world of construction and architecture** . All the objects in a BIM model therefore refer to materials from the construction industry: wall, posts, slabs, etc..



![BIM_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/BIM_Enjeux_et_Fondements/BIM_.jpeg)

- **M** can have different meanings:
  - Building Information **Model** : This is the digital model or mockup of the building. This is a set of data describing an existing project or building.
  - Building Information **Modeling** : It is a process of managing and creating data. By process we mean the fact that several participants will be able to have access to the same information at the same time.
  - Building Information **Management** : This is the organization, coordination and necessary control of the process that will use the data of the digital model and allow the sharing of information on the life cycle of a building.

The **I** is the most important letter of the acronym BIM.

**I** can refer to **information** : It will contain all the essential information about the project. This information is organized (by a tree structure in each of the objects), this information has a meaning: it corresponds to a specific property or a property shared by several objects.

**I** can also refer to **Intelligence** : The information is useful and can change, for example when we change the height of a wall, the surface of the wall changes but also the elevation of the slab associated with it... **The information can also be generated by means of algorithms** which for example will calculate the spacing between several metal studs in a complex facade ...

In brief, we can say that BIM is a **3D CAD model to which we have associated a database**.

We can retain the one proposed by Celnik & Lebegue in 2015, widely used in France: ‚ÄúBIM [for Building Information Model, Modeling or Management] is an **integrated way of working** , allowing the design, execution and management of buildings also integrated. **It is not a tool, a software, it is a process of work and collaboration** between stakeholders of a construction project based on specific tools that allow the design and operation of a digital mockup prefiguring the building as constructed and operated (...) ‚Äù.

**BIM is the sharing of reliable information throughout the lifespan** a building or infrastructure, from design to demolition.

## From üèóÔ∏è BIM to üèôÔ∏è CIM

------

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Until very recently, BIM was used for isolated buildings. We are now able to associate it with other buildings and neighborhoods to create smart cities. It is an expanded version of BIM that deals with the city more than the building. We have reached a technological stage which allows us to process a great amount of information at the same time: the level of pollution, the level of humidity, public lighting, roads, public infrastructures: bus, bike-sharing services ...



![CIM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bc-ars/plateform-images/main/BIM_Enjeux_et_Fondements/CIM.jpeg)

*CIM of the city of Monaco*

 

We can now **begin to simulate and predict the future of new neighborhoods before conception**.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### üå≥ LIM

---------------------------



**Landscape Information Modeling** will further expand the concept of information and modeling with natural spaces interaction. We will be based on scientific and technical data that will **take into account living things and their evolution in projects** . We can start to simulate the impact of the elements that constitute the landscape such as trees: their root system, humidity, growth, water consumption ... All the outdoor spaces will allow us to better think natural spaces and avoid, for example, floods, landslides, floods ... by taking into account the metadata of natural systems.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### **The** ideal **Smart City** : üèóÔ∏è BIM + üèôÔ∏è CIM + üå≥ LIM

------

 

BIM in agreement with CIM and LIM would make it possible to **define models at the scale of a district or even a city** , while providing all the information characterizing the modeling: a building and the basements, sewerage networks as well as all other underground networks (electricity, gas, water, etc.), green spaces and the wetland to integrate into the project, existing subsoil (pollution, water table, soil types ‚Ä¶), roads and public spaces.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

*The Smart City seen by Siemens*

 

The goal of tomorrow is not to know all the data of a city in real time: the water consumption by volume of each inhabitant, detection of the location of a leak in an underground pipeline. .. Municipal services would be submerged with information that would make them impossible to process.

Nevertheless, a reasoned Smart City thought upstream by public authorities will be a formidable tool for the development of cities and our impact on the environment.

Digital and its implementation through üèóÔ∏è BIM, üèôÔ∏è CIM & üå≥ LIM will be the essential tool in this evolution.
