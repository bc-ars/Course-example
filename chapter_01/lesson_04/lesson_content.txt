# üì∂ BIM Level of maturity 

------------------------------



The advantage of having a digital model and using BIM technology is to be able to collaborate between companies with internal and external teams. **In 2008, in the United Kingdom, Mark Bew and Mervyn Richards** developed a scheme for classifying the level of maturity of an organization.

## Level 0: Pre-BIM

-------------------------------



The majority of architectural firms are at level 0. This is the **traditional method of working** with minimal digital input. The drawings are first made on paper before being transcribed using 2D CAD. These different files are transmitted in .dwg, .pdf ... Each agency can have its own form of representation. Collaboration is not easy since it is necessary each time to check the general coherence of the project, and it is very difficult to standardize the exchanges.

## Level 1: Object-oriented modeling

-------------------------------

We reach a first real level of BIM with maturity level 1. An actor (usually the architect), creates a digital model using BIM software. We start first with the 3D geometry of the project, which is gradually enriched with information.The 3D model is used for visualization needs but not to exchange these data usefully with other trades.Collaboration **is still very weak** with exchanges in .dwg or. pdf. There is sometimes a centralization of data on an EDM (Electronic Document Management) or a drawing file. There may be some standardized exchanges with, for example, a graphic charter.

## Level 2: Object-oriented collaboration

-------------------------------

**Each discipline designs a digital model for its batch and its use** . They each allow **interoperability** . Actors can test, compare, and improve their models using other models from other profession: we talk about two-way exchanges. Models contain detailed information which interacts with parameters of the model and are therefore intelligent. **We now have a real collaboration** because this information is exchanged with all the models (in native or IFC formats) and no longer in the form of deliverables allowing only raw visualization (pdf type). Thanks to digital tools, we can compare different versions of a file, detect clashes between models and even notify users of changes instantly. The **update of each of the models is done asynchronously**.

## Level 3: Object-oriented collaboration

-------------------------------

This is the maximum BIM maturity level. We talk **about iBIM or integrated BIM** . It is a level which is still very little reached and sometimes remains at the state of theory. It is a **fully integrated and collaborative process**, accessible in the cloud via collaborative platforms. All the actors connect to a network to jointly power a single model. The exchanges become almost non-existent since everything is done in real time. The hierarchy of actors makes it possible to restrict access to different parts of the model and for example to the power to annotate. **There is full traceability of all events (Product Lifecycle Management)** .

We are still far from this level of maturity, for several reasons: conflicts between BIM software, server problems (can the blockchain solve the problem?), IFC format, etc.

With these levels of maturity, we understand **the importance of collaboration** within a BIM process and that, without it, the promises of BIM cannot be achieved. The passage from one level to another is not without effort but necessary. The different levels are illustrated by the company Arcadis above for a better understanding.
