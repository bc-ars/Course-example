### A project management method

-----------------------------------



  

As we have seen, **BIM is not software** and it would be reductive to define it simply as a digital model. Hundreds of BIM software exist around the world, each meeting the needs of one or more disciplines.

**BIM is part of the actors' strategy and project management**, it is their responsibility to make it their own. This strategy and the entire process that will result from it is based on more or less detailed BIM documentation, as we will see below.

### An accelerator for collaboration and operations management

-----------------------------------



<p>&nbsp;</p>

Depending on the scale and utility, **BIM** (Building Intelligence Modeling) can be transformed or added to **CIM** (City Intelligence Modeling) and **LIM** (Lanscape Intelligence Modeling). So many concepts that will gradually shift the most innovative cities towards the **Smart City**.

We will soon see how different actors can more easily collaborate together in the cycle of a project.

### A new way of representing reality

-----------------------------------

<p>&nbsp;</p>



The digital model is the most tangible part of BIM. We went from manual drawing, to 2D CAD then 3D CAD to arrive at **BIM: a parametric modeling** which will link geometrical representations to data through BIM objects. The tool is increasingly becoming an aid for the design and implementation of a building.
